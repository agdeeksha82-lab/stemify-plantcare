# stemify-plantcare
Stemify is an AI-powered system that compares plant stem images to detect diseases and provides intelligent, biological, and chemical treatment recommendations for improved plant health.
## 📖 About the Project

**Stemify** is an AI-powered plant stem disease detection and advisory system developed to assist **farmers, agricultural practitioners, and the general public** in identifying plant stem diseases at an early stage.

The system analyzes and **compares plant stem images** using deep learning and computer vision techniques to detect diseases and provide **intelligent recommendations**, including **biological and chemical treatment suggestions**, helping users make informed decisions for improved plant health.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect plant stem diseases using image-based AI analysis
* Compare healthy and infected stem conditions
* Provide AI-generated recommendations and guidance
* Suggest biological and chemical treatments for identified diseases
* Support early diagnosis and preventive crop care

## 🌿 Key Features

* AI-based plant stem disease detection
* Stem image comparison for accurate analysis
* Biological and chemical treatment recommendations
* Simple and user-friendly outputs
* Suitable for farmers and non-technical users

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A plant stem image is uploaded or captured
2. The image is preprocessed for analysis
3. Deep learning models analyze and compare stem features
4. Possible diseases are identified
5. The system generates recommendations and treatment suggestions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Deep Learning (CNN-based models)
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 👥 Intended Users
